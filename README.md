# Collective Attention Transformer (CAT) 🧠

Revolutionize your AI with the avant-garde CAT method. Streamline attention processes, making your transformer models more efficient without compromising on performance.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Efficient Attention**: Targets a collective set of tokens, reducing computational overhead.
- **Expressive Mechanism**: Maintains competitive performance while simplifying the attention process.
- **Scalability**: Handles longer sequences with reduced memory consumption.
- **Innovative Design**: A fresh perspective on attention mechanisms, designed for the challenges of modern datasets.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone and Navigate**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd CAT-Implementation
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install torch
3. **Dive into Collective Attention**:
   ```bash
   python cat_starter.py
🛠 Future Roadmap

🌐 Expand CAT to support multimodal attention across text, images, and sound.
🔍 Refine the collective selection process to ensure optimal token subsets.
🧪 Develop advanced attention visualizations to understand CAT's decision-making process.
